## ðŸŽ¥ Preview site :arrow_right: [live demo](https://szymonrojek.github.io/my-music-website/)

## Description:

Music is always with me - nylon gutiar is the biggest passion in my live so I have decided to create my personal music website and share my music with you. Please check it out.

## Technologies:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./src/images/npm-icon.png" width="50" height="50"></td>
    <td><img src="./src/images/parcel-js-icon.png" width="50" height="50"></td>
    <td><img src="./src/images/sass-icon.svg" width="50" height="50"></td>
    <td><img src="./src/images/flexbox-icon.png" width="50" height="50"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./src/images/html-icon.svg" width="50" height="50"></td>
    <td><img src="./src/images/css-icon.svg" width="50" height="50"> </td>
    <td><img src="./src/images/js-icon.svg" width="50" height="50"></td>
  </tr>
 </table>

## Goals achived:

- detecting if the user has requested theme color: light or dark by using(prefers-color-scheme);
- storing object in the browser { mode: light or dark } by using Local Storage
- manually switching the mode between light/dark (smooth transition)
- connect Contact Form with an external tool [Email.js](https://www.emailjs.com/)

EmailJS helps to send emails by using client-side technologies only. I have created an email template and at the end after successful error verification the user triggers sending an email by clicking the submit button.

- when form is submitted the form User immediately is information as a successful modal or Error Modal will appear if there were any errors on the way. In this case I have used an external tool [sweet alert](https://sweetalert2.github.io/#example/)

The form has two actions:

- check the inputs value on keyup change
- check the inputs value on submit

I have added a custom debounce function just to prevent unnecessary events being triggered on every inpout change, also there is an event delegation - in this case I have a single handler on their common ancestor.
